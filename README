== Welcome to NUCATS Assist

NUCATS Assist is a web-based application for managing institutional competitions. Currently
NUCATS Assist supports the creation of a competition framework, the publication of the 
competition and information about it, the ability of faculty and staff to authenticate to 
NUCATS Assist (using LDAP authentication) and submit proposals, and then build a review 
panel and assign reviews and run the review panel. The review criteria and panel setup 
mirrors the NIH study panel design by default.

== About NUCATS Assist

NUCATS Assist is written in Ruby on Rails and uses PostgreSQL as the backend database. 
It has the following major models to organize sponsoring organizations, competitions, 
reviewers, submitters, applicants, and reviews:

1. Sponsors 
	The sponsoring organization running the competition

2. Competitions
	The competitions to be managed

3. Users
	All individuals who log in or are listed with a role are in the Users table. Users may be administrators, reviewers, key personnel, or applicants.
	
4. Submissions
	Submissions have a submitter, an applicant (the submitter and applicant can be the same), key personnel, documents, a cover page, and assigned reviewers (assigned by the administrators of the sponsoring organization for the competition)
	
5. Reviews
	Reviews follow (by default) the NIH review criteria and consist of review categories (Overall, Significance, Investigators, Innovation, Approach, Environment by default) that can customized. Up to 7 categories in addition to Overall may be specified. A 1-9 score and descriptive text can be entered for each criterion. 

== Installing NUCATS Assist

Since NUCATS Assist is a standard Rails app, installing it is just like installing any other Rails app. NUCATS Assist is still a Rails 2.x app, although it runs fine with Ruby 1.9.3

== Running the test suite

NUCATS Assist has a number of unit tests, and running them requires Ruby 1.8.7. They do not run with 1.9.3. We do not recommend using Ruby 1.8.7 in production, however, due to some known security issues prior to 1.9.3.p327.
