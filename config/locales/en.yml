      Institute (NUCATS) initiative funded jointly by the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM), Northwestern
      Medical Faculty Foundation (NMFF), and Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH). Its mission is to create a single, comprehensive,
      and integrated repository of all medical data sources on the campus to facilitate operational, patient care, and research
      reporting. The EDW has been developed completely in-house, with no consulting fees.
    enotis: >
      eNOTIS is a web-based study enrollment log that helps to improve safety and security for study participant enrollment. This
      system is available now. Any biomedical clinical research study that has been approved by the NU IRB is listed in eNOTIS.
