    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <div id="definitions">
      <ul>
        <li>Minor Weakness: An easily addressable weakness that does not substantially lessen impact</li>
        <li>Moderate Weakness: A weakness that lessens impact </li>
        <li>Major Weakness: A weakness that severely limits impact  </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Considerations</h3>
    <div id="considerations">
      <p>
        Remember that because the research project usually is limited, a pilot grant application may not contain extensive detail or discussion. Preliminary data are not required. Accordingly, reviewers should evaluate the conceptual framework and general approach to the problem. NOTE: There is no requirement that the project eventually yield a new medical product or device; any project likely to have a significant positive impact on human health (including new techniques) is eligible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider as part of the overall score whether the proposed project addresses the stated objectives of the grant program which are to (1) address important unmet clinical needs, (2) provide seed funding for novel, high-risk ideas, (3) foster new interdisciplinary and cross-college, cross-institution collaborations, (4) provide funds to develop proof of concept data (additional future funding likely), and (5) fund milestone driven projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please also score the application on the individual criteria below to help improve the quality and transparency of review, as well as to help identify strengths and weaknesses of individual components. Remember that no direct correlation exists between individual criterion scores and the overall score you assign; you are instructed to weigh the different criteria as you see fit in deriving overall scores keeping in mind the goals of the program. An application does not need to be strong in all five core review criteria to be judged as likely to have major impact.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, please provide some information about the strengths and weaknesses of each section and the overall application. This feedback is very important to both the NUCATS leadership in final decision making, and also to the applicant for future revisions or in the event they submit a similar proposal elsewhere.
